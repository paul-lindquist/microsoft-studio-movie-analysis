    "# Movie Analysis for Microsoft Studios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors**: [Paul Lindquist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-lindquist/), [Steven Addison](https://www.linkedin.com/in/addisonse/), [Sumedh Bhardwaj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumedh-bhardwaj-932767202/), [Wahaj Dar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wahaj-dar-/)\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "This project postulates that Microsoft is launching a movie studio. We use exploratory data analysis to pitch recommendations to their stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "As this is a new venture for Microsoft, we want to be cognizant of cost and profitability. We offer several, data-driven approaches to maximize return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions we'll answer:\n",
    "* What genres of movies are lower risk to target as an entry point into the industry?\n",
    "* Are there types of movies or specific directors and actors that yield higher revenues?\n",
    "* Who are Microsoft's competitors and can anything be modeled from their successes?\n",
    "    * Does Microsoft have a catalogue of such content at their disposal?\n",
    "* When is the most profitable time to release movies?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "We use historical and categorical data from the box office and current movie landscape – release date, directors, actors, etc. – to examine correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focuses:\n",
    "* Particular focus given to cost (budget) and gross revenue (worldwide)\n",
    "* Drawing a correlation between revenue and genres, directors, actors, release date, etc.\n",
    "* Sourced from: [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/), [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/), [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "This project uses descriptive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "Horror movies yield the lowest average cost and highest average profit margins, offering a strategic, lower-risk entry point into the industry:\n",
    "\n",
    "![graph1](./images/roi_by_genre.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A handful of directors helm movies that historically yield high revenues. It would be worthwhile exploring the availability of these directors to direct a big budget movie:\n",
    "\n",
    "![graph2](./images/stevendirectorfig.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 2 competing studios with the highest revenues (Buena Vista/Disney, Warner Bros) own blockbuster comic book franchises (Marvel, DC Comics, respectively). A comparable franchise could be fashioned from high-grossing Microsoft games (Halo, Gears of War, Forza Motorsport, etc.):\n",
    "\n",
    "![graph3](./images/sumedhstudioupdfig.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Target the release month of big budget movies for May, June or July, as these 3 months historically yield the highest average revenues:\n",
    "\n",
    "![graph4](./images/average_profit_release_month.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "Based on our analysis, we make the following suggestions for the business:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **An early focus should be placed on making horror movies.** According to the data, they historically yield the lowest average cost and highest average profit margins. They'll serve as an initial, lower-risk entry point.\n",
    "* **When moving into big budget, blockbuster movies, target specific directors and/or actors who've historically yielded high box office revenues.** Top 3 directors: Russo brothers, Joss Whedon, James Wan. Top 3 actors: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. Top 3 actresses: Scarlett Johansson, Jennifer Lawrence, Bryce Dallas Howard.\n",
    "* **Explore creating movie franchises out of Microsoft intellectual property, namely video games.** The top 2 competing studios with the highest revenues (Buena Vista/Disney, Warner Bros) own Marvel and DC comics, respectively. A comparable franchise could be fashioned from high-grossing Microsoft games (Halo, Gears of War, Forza Motorsport, etc.)\n",
    "* **Release big budget movies in May, June or July.** These 3 months historically yield the highest average revenues.\n",
